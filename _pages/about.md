I’m a second-year CS PhD student at the University of Warwick, where I am fortunately supervised by [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/). My research focuses on understanding sparse neural networks through the lens of graph theory. I am also interested in (but not limited to) improving the efficiency of training large models.

Before that, I spent 6 months as Research Assistant at VinUniversity working with [Prof. Khoa D Doan](https://khoadoan.me/). Prior to that, I was an AI resident at FPT Software AI Center where I was advised by [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/), [Prof. Dung Le Duy](https://andrew-dungle.github.io/), and [Dr. Anh Ta-The](https://the-anhta.github.io/). I was a member of [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) in Hanoi University of Science and Technology where I earned my Engineering Degree in Computer Science.
