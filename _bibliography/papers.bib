  abstract = {Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit. Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the trainability of various sparse network architectures.},

  abstract = {Pruning at Initialization (PaI) is a technique in neural network optimization characterized by the proactive elimination of weights before the network's training on designated tasks. This innovative strategy potentially reduces the costs for training and inference, significantly advancing computational efficiency. A key factor leading to PaI's effectiveness is that it considers the saliency of weights in an untrained network, and prioritizes the trainability and optimization potential of the pruned subnetworks. Recent methods can effectively prevent the formation of hard-to-optimize networks, e.g. through iterative adjustments at each network layer. However, this way often results in large-scale discrete optimization problems, which could make PaI further challenging. This paper introduces a novel method, called DPaI, that involves a differentiable optimization of the pruning mask. DPaI adopts a dynamic and adaptable pruning process, allowing easier optimization processes and better solutions. More importantly, our differentiable formulation enables readily use of the existing rich body of efficient gradient-based methods for PaI. Our empirical results demonstrate that DPaI significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art PaI methods on various architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision-Transformers.}

  abstract = {Recently, backdoor attacks have become an emerging threat to the security of machine learning models. From the adversary's perspective, the implanted backdoors should be resistant to defensive algorithms, but some recently proposed fine-tuning defenses can remove these backdoors with notable efficacy. This is mainly due to the catastrophic forgetting (CF) property of deep neural networks. This paper counters CF of backdoors by leveraging continual learning (CL) techniques. We begin by investigating the connectivity between a backdoored and fine-tuned model in the loss landscape. Our analysis confirms that fine-tuning defenses, especially the more advanced ones, can easily push a poisoned model out of the backdoor regions, making it forget all about the backdoors. Based on this finding, we re-formulate backdoor training through the lens of CL and propose a novel framework, named Sequential Backdoor Learning (SBL), that can generate resilient backdoors. This framework separates the backdoor poisoning process into two tasks: the first task learns a backdoored model, while the second task, based on the CL principles, moves it to a backdoored region resistant to fine-tuning. We additionally propose to seek flatter backdoor regions via a sharpness-aware minimizer in the framework, further strengthening the durability of the implanted backdoor. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive empirical experiments on several benchmark datasets in the backdoor domain.},
